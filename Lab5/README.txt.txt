For this website I was able to create a login page based on the original project
by Dr. Robert Marmorstein in Web Programming at Longwood University. I was able
to expand on this assignment by creating another page that allows the user to
draw by using different shapes with different colors.

To use this drawing site, you must use the login:

USERNAME: test
PASSWORD: test
