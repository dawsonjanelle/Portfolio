	<p>My favorite movie is The Hunger Games. The movie takes place in a country called Panem that is under the rule of President Snow. The country is made up of 12 districts that all have specific jobs relating to their region. For example, District 12 is coal mining. Each year the capital of Panem, which houses the elite, hosts The Hunger Games. For this event, each district must select two victors, one boy, and one girl, who will fight to the death in an arena. The plot thickens throughout the entire series of 4 movies as it becomes more mature and focuses on corruption and inequality within Panem and the Districts instead of the main plot being about the games.
