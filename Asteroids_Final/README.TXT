Lab 5: Asteroids!

Janelle Dawson

This is a simple asteroids game writen by Dr. Robert Marmorstein and updated by
his students.  It illustrates how to create and use classes in C++.  It relies
heavily on the SSDL library by Dr. Will Briggs, which must be installed for
this software to work.



HOW TO PLAY:

compile: make
run: ./Asteroids_Final

Avoid getting hit by the alien enemies in UFOs! Asteriods are there to help block the aliens from you. Avoid getting attacked by shooting bullets at the enemies using the SPACE BAR.





What did I change in this program?
	1.  I added different colors to the stars including white, pink, and dark purple.

	2.  I changed the size of the player image to 64x64 pixels.	

	3.  I changed all of the images in the game. Ship1 is now Ship3 (from arrow image to a person in a car), 
	    Ship2 is now Ship4 (enemy ship arrow image to alien in UFO), Rock is now Rock2 (orange/borown rock 
            to stone looking rock).

	4. I added/created an image of Earth in the background.
	
	5. I created bullet.h and bullet.cpp, as well as added code to the main.cpp file in order to make it 
	   possible for the player to shoot bullets.

	6. I added/created an image for bullets.
