Dragon

How to use:

compile: make
run: ./Dragon


After running this program, an image of a traced over image
of a Chinese Dragon should appear in the window (image software 
used was Paint.NET, which is similar to Photoshop). To add more to 
the program, I used FreeSounds to attempt to find some traditional 
Chinese music to add to the background, as well as added an image
of the fire emoji to make it look as though the dragon was breathing
fire.
