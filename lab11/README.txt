The Maze - Janelle


Based on a program by Dr. Julian Dymacek at Longwood Univerty, and was expanded on by his students.
My group used a random maze generator found on github.

The items, controls, shop, different menus, coordinates, as well as some edits to the maze and more were created by myself.


PLAYER: you are the hot pink @ symbol. 

Controls:
[q] to leave game
[2] to open shop
[w][a][s][d] to move


$ = Coins - give 1 coin (you start with 10000 coins)
% = Extra Stamina - give 1 stamina (buying pellets with coins will give 5 if used) (you start with 10 bars of stamina, you can gain more)
O = Black Hole - deal 2 damage and teleports you somewhere in the maze
^ = Spikes - deal 1 damage


*Use letters known next to items to use and buy them!
[r] - stamina pellets
[t] - teleportation device
[p] - health potion

To Run:
