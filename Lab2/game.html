<!-- Bobby's House (room 1):In this room Bobby is in his house yet to start his adventure. In this room, the player must decide how to start his journey. They have the option to go to the basement or to go into the front yard. -->

<!-- Some things you should consider while grading: I drew all of these images myself on my laptop, which took some time to do. I changed the color of the background on the <h2> tags. I also tried to come up with a story that kind of made sense (I hope it does), and had at least some player decision that caused some different outcomes throughout the game. -->

			<h2>Bobby's House</h2>
			<p id=text class=house>
			Welcome to the Glowing Village, this is Bobby's house! In this village there are myths of a Princess named Adrienne Victorine. It is said that a witch stuck her up in a tower 12 years ago, and she hasn't been seen since. Bobby's life long dream is to be able to become a knight and join the ranks to save the princess. The only problem with that though is to join the ranks Bobby would need to be 18 and he is only 10. He is about to venture out on his own to find the missing princess, but not without your help! Guide Bobby through his journey to find Princess Adrienne Victorine! Choose where you go wisely, because you may fall into a trap!
