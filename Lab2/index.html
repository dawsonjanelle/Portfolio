		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p id=about class=section>
		My name is Janelle Dawson and I am from Fredericksburg, Virginia. In Virginia, the weather is extremely bipolar. It can be almost 70 degrees one day and then snow and cause school cancellations the next day. Anyways, a fun fact about me is that I can hula hoop with 20 hula hoops, maybe even more.

		<h2>My Family</h2>
		<p id=family class=section>
		I have two younger sisters who are twins. To make life even more confusing, their names are SUPER similar, Brandi and Brianne. Good luck telling them apart, half of my family still can't so... I have an amazing older brother who is 30 (almost 31). Yep, 12 years older than me! He is the one that got me into computer science. When I was little, he played the whole Disney Princess Wii game for me because I couldn't beat the levels. Your brother definitely isn't as cool as mine.

		<h2>My Classes</h2>
		<p id=classes class=section>
		This semester I am taking 15 credits in total. I plan on taking some classes in the summer for Communication Studies. I do not know how Computer Science classes go over the summer, so I am not sure if I will take any of those until Fall 2022. My schedule this semester is nice because my earliest class is 11am every single day. This leaves me time to do some work in the morning, stay up a little later if needed, actually eat breakfast sometimes, etc. My classes are as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Public Speaking | Monday, Wednesday, Friday @ 11am</li>
			<li>Intro. to Algorthmic Design II |  Monday, Wednesday, Friday @ 1pm and Thursday @ 12:30pm</li>
			<li>Web Page Design and Scripting |  Monday Wednesday, Friday @ 2pm</li>
			<li>Honors: Historical Inquiry II - Radical Thinking |  Tuesday and Thursday @ 11pm</li>
			<li>Discrete Mathematics | Wednesday and Friday @ 12pm</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Career Plans</h2>
		<p id=plans class=section>
		I don't know exactly what I want to do after college yet. I would love to make games with a company like Insomniac or something, but I'd also love to do something with social media platforms. Another thing I might do is try to work for the government, but I am not really sure what I want to do at the moment.
