It will take you to the a website that shows information about myself and my family,
as well as a "resume," that was made for fun in class. Both the "Home" and "Resume" 
tabs were given on an assignment by Dr. Robert Marmorstein in Computer Science 210: 
Web Programming at Longwood University. What I added into the project can be seen in 
the "Adventure Game" tab, which will take you through a story based game with a 
storyline and images created by me, that contains different options leading to different 
outcomes. Use the tabs at the top of the screen to play the game.
